Recently I have been building a music portal website
`djmusic20.tekverse.com`_. It based on several web services:
`audioscrobbler`_, wikipedia `FUTEF api`_, `YouTube`_, and `Technorati`_
. I used `Django`_ to build it. This site is still very fragile. The
unicode issue has to be solved and other bugs have to be cleaned. Also,
it's quite ugly right now. I wish I could find a web designer who can
prettify it and give it a slick layout. Maybe I should spend some times
dig into `Gimp`_ and try to tweak the CSS myself...Anyway, at least it
works now, feel free to type in your band or artist's name and see what
you can find :)
