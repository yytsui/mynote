Besides [MIT SIMILE Timeline](http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/), I just discovered  [XTimeline](http://www.xtimeline.com/), an even more easy way to build the timeline on the webpage. Well, I mean more easy if you do it manually. To give it a try, I discovered this article [Timeline: Countdown to the 2010 Olympic Games](http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080208/VAN2010_timeline_080208/20080208/) by Google. [Here](http://www.xtimeline.com/timeline/Timeline-Countdown-to-the-2010-Olympic-Games) is how it looks for the first three events.
