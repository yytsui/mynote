Recently while  I was setting [buildbot](http://buildbot) for the continuous integration of my project, my friend told me he was drawing ideas about community building  into a mindmap. So why don't I also try to jot down what I learn from buildbot as mindmap...after one and half hours fun with [xmind](http://xmind.net),  here is the result then.
