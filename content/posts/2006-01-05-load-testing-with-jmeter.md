Today I tried[ JMeter ](http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/index.html), an open source web load testing tool. It's easy to  setup web test, ftp test, and web service test.
...etc. Just following the well-written document step by step , a test plan is set up in minutes. Then just press run, you can see the load testing result graph in real time. Other advantages for testing automation include:
   1.Besides its easy-to-use GUI , the test plans are save as XML files and command mode is provided also. That's mean that you can parsing your test plan document into the specific XML file and run the testing automatically. 
  2.User case recording is also available. 
 In addition, users can also [wrtie customized plugins.  ](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/jakarta/jmeter/trunk/xdocs/extending/jmeter_tutorial.pdf?revision=325123&pathrev=325123)
   This tool is definitely worth to try when evaluating web hosting.
