| If you have ever thought about rent a place near locations you prefer
to live, then using Google Maps API is a good idea. By spidering
http://rentfaster.ca lists into a MySQL database using Python and then
presenting it by Google Maps API and PHP, I made this webpage
`http://rentfaster.tekverse.com`_. The search results of Calgary
houses/apartments/condos â€¦etc for rent depending on your criteria will
show up as markers in the Google Map.

|  Update: Since rentfaster.ca has changed ther web sites structure, so
the spidering part is not wroking any more, that is, the database is out
of date. Hopefully, I will have time to update the spidering part of
this program in near future. Apr 23, 2006.
