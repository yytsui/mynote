title: Rent a house by locations - A Google Maps Application
wordpress_id: 8
tags: Google Maps

If you have ever thought about rent a place near locations you prefer to live, then using Google Maps API is a good idea. By spidering [http://rentfaster.ca ](http://rentfaster.ca) lists into a MySQL database using Python and then presenting it by Google Maps API and PHP, I made this webpage [http://rentfaster.tekverse.com ](http://rentfaster.tekverse.com ). The search results of Calgary houses/apartments/condos â€¦etc for rent depending on your criteria  will show up as markers in the Google Map.

Update: Since rentfaster.ca has changed ther web sites structure, so the spidering part is not wroking any more, that is, the database is out of date. Hopefully, I will have time to update the spidering part of this program in near future. Apr 23, 2006.
