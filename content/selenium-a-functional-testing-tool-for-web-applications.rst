| `Selenium`_ is a functional testing tool, which uses an browser driven
by JavaScript to play back testing scripts, for Web applications.
Actually, a tester does not have to write the Javascripts,
`Selenium-IDE`_, a Firefox extension, can be used to record and edit
user cases. The user cases are save as HTML tables or Ruby scripts. That
means that user cases are also programmable. Here is screenshot of
Selenium IDE. It's quite intuitive and handy!
