[Selenium](http://www.openqa.org/selenium/) is a functional testing tool, which uses an browser driven by JavaScript to play back testing scripts, for Web applications. Actually, a tester does not have to write the Javascripts, [ Selenium-IDE](http://www.openqa.org/selenium-ide/), a Firefox extension, can be used to record and edit user cases. The  user cases  are save as HTML tables or Ruby scripts. That means that user cases are also programmable. Here is screenshot of Selenium IDE. It's quite intuitive and handy!
