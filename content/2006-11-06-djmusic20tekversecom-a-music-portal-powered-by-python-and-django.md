Recently I have been building a music portal website [djmusic20.tekverse.com](http://djmusic20.tekverse.com). It based on several web services: [audioscrobbler](http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/webservices/), wikipedia [FUTEF api](http://api.futef.com/apidocs.html), [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/dev), and [Technorati](http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/TechnoratiApi) . I used [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) to build it. This site is still very fragile. The unicode issue has to be solved and other bugs have to be cleaned. Also, it's quite ugly right now. I wish I could find a web designer who can prettify it and give it a slick layout. Maybe I should spend some times dig into [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) and try to tweak the CSS myself...Anyway, at least it works now, feel free to type in your band or artist's name and see what you can find :)
