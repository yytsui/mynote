Recently while  I was setting `buildbot`_ for the continuous integration
of my project, my friend told me he was drawing ideas about community
building  into a mindmap. So why don't I also try to jot down what I
learn from buildbot as mindmap...after one and half hours fun with
`xmind`_,  here is the result then.
